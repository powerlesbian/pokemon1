first jab at rendering pokemon api under week 15 data fetch and render

This test repo was developed mainly to experiment with data fetch, rendering and manipulation.

It makes use of useEffect to manage fetch of online data


I kept is clean and simple as possible as that seems to be the trend these days, but plenty of scope to add more styling once I sort out the data, which itself is a real challenge. 

Reflecting on the process: 
What did you find challenging?

The coding part.  The still unfamiliar syntax and pinata of curly braces, brackets and square brackets that pepper the screen. 

What did you enjoy? 

I enjoyed exploring all the API resources and understanding how to use them.

What do you want to learn more about?

I want to learn more about REST APIs and how to use them.
